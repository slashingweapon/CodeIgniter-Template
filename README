README

This is a CodeIgniter project template which I use as a starting point for my contracting
practice.  It is a standard CI project, with a few useful additions.

* application/library/Smarty.php gives you a trivially simple way to integrate Smarty into your
application.  See the headerdoc in that file for more information.

* application/library/Fmp.php integrates the FileMaker database libraries with your project.  See
the headerdoc in that file for more information.

* application/library/MY_Session.php overrides the default CI session handling and replaces it with
standard PHP sessions, nicely wrapped up in CI goodness.  See the headerdoc for details.

* public/index.php has been modified to support an ENVIRONMENT constant defined by the server.

* public/index.php includes FileMaker.php

REQUIREMENTS

CodeIgniter 2.x:  You will need to put your CodeIgniter_2.0.2/system folder into this this one, and call it
"system".

Smarty 3.x: The Smarty folder has to be somewhere in your PHP include path.

FileMaker PHP libraries need to be in your PHP include path.

Apache's ModRewrite must be installed and enabled.

FILE PERMISSIONS

As always, the entire directory needs to be recursively readable by the web server.  Additionally,
the tmp directory needs to be recursively writable by the web server too.  This is where smarty 
will keep its compiled templates and caches, and where session data files will be stored.

A typical setup where the 'deploy' user owns the files and 'www-data' is the web server group,
you will likely use these commands (or something similar) during deployment:

	sudo chown -R deploy:www-data .
	sudo chmod -R ug+r .
	sudo chmod -R ug+w tmp
	sudo chmod -R o-rw .

APACHE CONFIGURATION

The virtual host should point into the public directory, and include rewrite rules that
map any unknown files to index.php.

You can use APPLICATION_ENV to control which kind of environment you're working in, and thus which
configurations to use.  The usual values are 'production', 'staging', and 'development'.  I often
find it is useful to install with APPLICATION_ENV initially set to 'development' so I can see the
PHP errors while I'm shaking down an installation, and then change it to 'production' after 
everything is running.


<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot "/Users/cj/Sites/playground/public"
	ServerName playground
	
	
	SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV production
	
	<Directory /Users/cj/Sites/playground/public>
		Options FollowSymLinks SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
		DirectoryIndex index.html index.php
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
		
		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteBase /
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Don't forget to restart Apache after you've added the vhost configuration.
